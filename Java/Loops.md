# Loops

## For Loop

We use for loop when we know how many times we want the loop to execute.

```java
for (int i = 2; i < 10; i++) {
	System.out.println(i);
}
```

## While Loop
We use while loop when we don't know how many times we want the loop to execute.

```java
int i = 1;

while (i < 10) {
	System.out.pritnln(i);
	i++;
}
```

## Do While Loop
We use do while loop when we want the loop to execute at least once.

```java
int i = 1;

do {
	System.out.println(i);
} while (i < 10)
```
